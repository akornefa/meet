Meet is  a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven
development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch
upcoming events. It displays a list of events the users can search for by city. It also
shows a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city.

to run, type "npm run start"
